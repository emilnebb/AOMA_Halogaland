# Automatic Operational Modal Analysis on Halogaland bridge

This is a repository for performing automatic operational modal analysis on vibration data from the Halogaland bridge. 
The code in this repository created the foundation for my master thesis at the Department of Structural Engineering at NTNU,
written in the spring of 2023.
